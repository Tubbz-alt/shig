# System76 Human Interface Guidelines

The System76 Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) are designed to help our developers
and designers maintain a consistent and pleasant experience for end users across
our web and desktop products.

## Dialogs & Actions

When presenting a dialog or action, include Primary and Secondary text as well
as Actions.

### Primary Text

Basic information and a suggestion.

### Secondary Text

Further details, including any non-obvious consequences of actions.

### Actions

Aligned right-to-left at the bottom of the UI. Affirmative/suggested action,
cancel (if applicable), and any secondary actions.

## Common Terms to Use & Avoid

### Products

If you are unable to know the explicit type, use the generic term
"product" when referring to a customer's product. Avoid semi-generic terms like
"computer". If you can determine whether it's a laptop, desktop, accessory,
etc., use that more specific term. If you know the specific product, use its
product name when it makes sense.

### Payment Methods

Use the term "payment methods", not "transaction methods", "payment cards", or
anything else when being generic. If you know the type of a specific payment
method in context (i.e. a card or financing), feel free to be more specific.
However, avoid "credit card" or "debit card", since we can't distinguish between
the two; instead, just say, "card".
